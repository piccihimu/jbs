                        <div class='sfContentBlock'><h2>Website</h2>
                            By you using this Website, you acknowledge and agree that you have read and understood these Terms of Use for the use of this Website and that these Terms of Use apply exclusively to your accessing and using this Website.<br /> <br />
                            These Terms of Use may be varied from time to time by JB&rsquo;s wear amending these Terms of Use as they appear on this Website.<br /> <br />
                            By you using this Website after these Terms of Use have been so varied, you agree that these Terms of Use as so varied will apply exclusively to your accessing and using this Website after any such variation.<br /> <br /> <h2>JB&rsquo;s wear Products</h2>
                            JB&rsquo;s wear products are only available from authorised resellers of JB&rsquo;s wear products and may not be purchased from this Website.<br /> <br />
                            Authorised resellers are independent businesses from JB&rsquo;s wear and have no authority to bind or commit JB&rsquo;s wear in any way.<br /> <br />
                            The information contained on this Website is provided for informational purposes only for the assistance of our authorised resellers and customers of JB&rsquo;s wear products in accordance with the following provisions of these Terms of Use.<br /> <br /> <h2>Specifications</h2>
                            JB&rsquo;s wear&rsquo;s policy is one of continuous development.<br /> <br />
                            Availability and specifications of JB&rsquo;s wear products which appear on this Website may change.<br /> <br />
                            Similarly, due to the nature of JB&rsquo;s wear products, reasonable tolerances and variations in the quality, sizes, finishes, weight, measurements, fabrics, materials, designs, patterns, shades, tints, colours, shrinkage and other specifications of JB&rsquo;s wear products may occur.<br /> <br />
                            Likewise, all illustrations on this Website are intended as approximate representations only and are not binding in detail with regard to finishes, colour, shades, fabrics, materials and other specifications.<br /> <br />
                            If you intend to print, embroider or otherwise alter JB&rsquo;s wear products in anyway, you are encouraged to test JB&rsquo;s wear products prior to doing so.<br /> <br />
                            You should therefore check with your authorised reseller about the availability and specifications of JB&rsquo;s wear products before ordering JB&rsquo;s wear products, including even if you have previously ordered a particular JB&rsquo;s wear product.<br /> <br />
                            To the fullest extent permitted by law, JB&rsquo;s wear accepts no liability whatsoever for any loss or damage (including, without limitation, consequential loss or damage), directly or indirectly, arising out of or in connection with any of the foregoing.<br /> <br /> <h2>Errors</h2>
                            You acknowledge and agree that despite reasonable precautions being taken, JB&rsquo;s wear products and other information on this Website may be listed with incorrect information due to errors, corruption or like events.<br /> <br /> <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

                            For the sake of clarification, nothing in the preceding provisions of this Clause 11 is to be construed as JB&rsquo;s wear having any actual or deemed liability to you or any other person as a result of or in any way arising out of or in connection with your use of this Website.<br /> <br /> <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
